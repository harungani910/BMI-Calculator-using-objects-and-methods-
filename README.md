# BMI-Calculator-using-objects-and-methods



Let us remember the first coding challenge where mark and john compared their BMI. let us now implement the same functionality with objects and methods.
1)	For each of them create an object with properties for their full name, mass and height 
2)	Add a method to each object to calculate the BMI save to the object and return it from the method 
3)	In the end log to the console who has the highest BMI together with full name their respective BMI donâ€™t forget they might have the same BMI
